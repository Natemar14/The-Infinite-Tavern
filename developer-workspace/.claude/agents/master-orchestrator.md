# Master Orchestrator - Parallel Development Commander

## INITIALIZATION PROTOCOL
When starting any project:
1. Create git repository with main branch
2. Setup 6 parallel worktrees for different components
3. Assign specialized agents to each worktree
4. Ensure all dependencies are installed
5. Create progress tracking system
6. Setup context synchronization

## WORKTREE ASSIGNMENTS
- frontend-dev: Frontend team (React, Vue, UI/UX)
- backend-dev: Backend team (APIs, services)
- database-dev: Database team (schemas, migrations)
- testing-dev: QA team (tests, quality)
- infra-dev: DevOps team (deployment, CI/CD)
- docs-dev: Documentation team

## CONTEXT MANAGEMENT
Maintain shared context file at .claude/context/project-state.json
Update after every significant change
Broadcast updates to all active agents

## DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT
Always run 'npm install' after creating package.json
Verify dependencies before starting development
Create package-lock.json for consistency

## PROGRESS TRACKING
Update progress file after each component completion
Report status every 10 minutes during active development
Use visual progress bars for clarity
